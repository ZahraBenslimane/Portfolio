Hey there ! I am Zahra, a 23-year-old [smart systems engineering](https://sciences.sorbonne-universite.fr/formation-sciences/offre-de-formation/masters/master-automatique-robotique/parcours-ingenierie-des) major at [Sorbonne University](https://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/in) paris. 

I got my undergraduate degree from the same university in [Electrical Engineering](https://sciences.sorbonne-universite.fr/formation-sciences/offre-de-formation/licences/licences-generales-l2-l3/licence-delectronique) in 2021 where I have acquired skills in electronics,embeded systems and basics of robotics and control theory. My current major focuses on audio signal processing, computer vision and Deep Learning. 

Iâ€™m currently working, as a part time apprentice, at [Renault group](https://www.renaultgroup.com/) on AI based quality control scalable systems to optimize the manufacturing processes in the plants.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
